            Akira Toriyama, born on April 5, 1955, in Nagoya, Japan, showed an early interest in drawing, particularly influenced by the works of Osamu Tezuka, the renowned manga artist. After graduating from high school, Toriyama enrolled in a technical school to study advertising. However, he soon found himself drawn back to his passion for art and manga. Toriyama began submitting his manga works to various competitions and publishers while working as a designer for a small advertising agency.

In 1978, Toriyama achieved his breakthrough with the publication of his one-shot manga "Wonder Island" in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine. This led to his serialization debut with "Dr. Slump" in 1980, a comedic series that quickly gained popularity for its whimsical characters and humor. "Dr. Slump" laid the foundation for Toriyama's distinctive art style and storytelling techniques, showcasing his knack for blending comedy with elements of science fiction and adventure.

Toriyama's career reached new heights with the creation of "Dragon Ball" in 1984, a manga series that became a cultural phenomenon both in Japan and internationally. Spanning over a decade, "Dragon Ball" followed the adventures of Goku and his friends as they journeyed through fantastical worlds, battling powerful foes and collecting mystical artifacts. The series' success catapulted Toriyama to global fame and solidified his status as one of the most influential manga artists of all time.

Beyond "Dragon Ball," Toriyama continued to innovate and collaborate across various media. He provided character designs for several video games, including the iconic "Dragon Quest" series, and worked on other manga projects such as "Cowa!" and "Sand Land." Despite his immense success, Toriyama remained known for his modesty and reclusive nature, preferring to focus on his work rather than the spotlight.

In recent years until his passing, Toriyama had continued to engage with his fans through interviews and occasional artwork. Although he has scaled back his involvement in creating new manga series, his legacy as a pioneer of the manga industry endures, with "Dragon Ball" remaining a beloved franchise cherished by generations of fans worldwide. But unfortunately Toriyama had passed away at the age of 68 on March 1, 2024.
